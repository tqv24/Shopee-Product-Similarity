# Product Matching Project README

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning solution for product matching, particularly aimed at determining whether two different images represent the same product or two distinct items. The objective is to assist retailers in maintaining competitive pricing and to provide customers with accurate product listings, thereby enhancing their shopping experience.

## Description

The project employs a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques to analyze image and text information for comparing product similarity. It addresses challenges posed by variations in images, titles, and product descriptions through robust algorithms and feature engineering strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project comprises product data from a prominent e-commerce platform, encompassing features such as posting IDs, images, image hashes, titles, label groups, etc. Preprocessing steps are applied to ensure dataset compatibility with machine learning models and to extract relevant features for product matching.

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and formatting the dataset, handling missing values, and extracting relevant features.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracting features from images and text data, such as image embeddings and text embeddings, for effective product representation.
3. Model Development: Training machine learning models, including deep learning models for image analysis and traditional models for text analysis, to predict product matches.
4. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, and recall.

## Results

The results of the product matching algorithm are evaluated based on the mean F1 score, with higher scores indicating better performance. The final output is a submission file in CSV format containing the predicted matches for each posting ID.

## Conclusion

By implementing this product matching solution, the project aims to enhance the efficiency of online retail operations and provide customers with more accurate product listings. It has the potential to benefit both retailers and customers by facilitating competitive pricing and improving the overall shopping experience.
